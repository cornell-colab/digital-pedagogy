# FERPA At Cornell

## What is FERPA?

## Why is FERPA important?

## FERPA & Digital Pedagogy

1. If you have any questions or concerns, consult the Cornell University FERPA policy first.
2. Only use university approved platforms to transmit regulated data. To find approved platforms, consult the Cornell IT Regulated Data Chart. (NOTE: At Cornell, Google Suite apps such as Cmail and Google Drive are **not** university approved platforms.)
3. Student work may be hosted on university approved platforms with student consent ONLY.
4. Refrain from posting any student directory information or other educational records online or to the cloud.
5. Tell students early in the semester (ideally before their course shopping period ends) that your class includes public-facing writing online, and inform students of their privacy rights protection under FERPA. Invite students to discuss concerns with you privately.  
6. Create a substitute assignment for students who do not wish to post their work online or to the cloud, and make clear that student grades are not dependent on digital engagement. If such engagement is a necessity to pass your course, make this explicitly clear to students early on.
7. Require students to use pseudonyms or usernames online, such that their real names remain private to those outside of the classroom. 
8. Restrict students from posting any identifying information about themselves, other students, or the class. This may arise in minor (yet telling) ways, such as dorm building names or extracurricular clubs. (One might turn this into a teaching moment about internet privacy and traceability.)
9. Never send or discuss student grades or evaluations via email or non-university approved cloud platforms. 
10. Parent requests to see student educational records must be handled through the Office of University Counsel. Students retain full life rights over FERPA disclosure from the moment they enroll at Cornell, and parents do not automatically recieve a disclosure exception except in particular scenarios. If there is a question or issue with a parent, contact general counsel at the Office of University Counsel immediately.
